## 🚀 What is SnapAct?

SnapAct is a Gen Z-first mobile app designed to turn everyday citizens into instant urban problem solvers.

**How it works in under 4 seconds:**
1. Open app → back camera instantly activates (zero clicks)
2. Point & snap the issue (pothole, broken streetlight, waste pile, etc.)
3. AI instantly:
   - Detects & categorizes the problem
   - Pins exact GPS coordinates
   - Routes the report to the correct local authority
4. You get a slick confirmation + follow-up reminders until it’s fixed

No forms. No typing. No bullshit.

Built for speed, transparency, and that satisfying “I just made my city better” dopamine hit.
